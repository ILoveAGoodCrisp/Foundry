[H2AMPEK](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1695790/Halo_2_Anniversary_MP_Mod_Tools__MCC/)

To install the afformentioned editing kits, you must own the respective MCC title on Steam.

> [!CAUTION]
> Remove any previous installations of Foundry before following the installation guide. The legacy addon version may conflict with the extension.

## Installation

Foundry only needs to be installed once. Thereafter, you can use Blender to download any future updates automatically. If you would prefer to install a local standalone version of Foundry, skip to the Standalone Installation instructions below this section.

- Launch Blender and open Preferences <div align="left"> <img src="img/install0.png"> </div>
- Navigate to the **Get Extensions** tab and then click **Repositories**
- On the **Repositories** windows click the `+` icon and then **Add Remote Repository** <div align="left"> <img src="img/install1.png"> </div>
- In the **Add New Extension Repository** window copy and paste the following text into the **URL** field: `https://iloveagoodcrisp.github.io/Foundry/api/v1/extensions/index.json`
- I recommend checking the **Check for Updates on Startup** box, but this is optional
-  Now click **Create** to link the remote repository to Blender <div align="left"> <img src="img/install2.png"> </div>
- Enter `Foundry` into the search box and you should see the **Foundry** addon show up with an option to install <div align="left"> <img src="img/install3.png"> </div>
